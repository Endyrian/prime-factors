# prime-factors

## About the Project

I desired to have a quick way to determine the prime factorization of a given number. Given that one of the functions I had implemented as part of this was a partial implementation of binary insertion sort, I decided to create a full implementation of that as well.

### Built With

This project uses python's standard `math` library. No other libraries are used.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this program, you will need a python interpreter.

### Installation

To install, download `my_primes.py` and `my_binary_sort.py`.

## Usage

Both `my_primes.py` and `my_binary_sort.py` are intended to be used as libraries. However, both may be run as standalone programs.

To use `my_primes.py`, run it in the command line. When prompted, enter an integer. You should see a list of all of said integer's prime factors printed out, including duplicate factors. You may either continue to enter integers or type 'q' to end the program.

To use `my_binary_sort.py`, run it in the command line. When prompted, enter a list of integers. You should see a sorted version of that list printed out.
